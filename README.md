- 👋 Hi, I’m @digiu94, an IT student, looking for knowledge, from Asti, Italy.
- I have almost 10 years of experience in building and maintenance of refrigeration plants.
- Looking for new knowledge, and as I was always intrested in IT and Technology, I decided to start from scratch in this new adventure.
- 👀 I’m interested mainly in networking and development (not sure what i like the most for now). 
- 🌱 I'm studying IT in High Scool for adults, along with my day job as a Refrigeration and HVAC Project Manager, to gain a good basic knoledge of the subjects. In our         class we are learning basics of Java, Html, CSS, PHP and SQL, and networking. I'm also studying for the Cisco CCNA certification. 
-     Can't wait to get my High Scool qualification this year!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on basic problems to better understand the topics i'm studying, for future prospective of working in the IT field.
